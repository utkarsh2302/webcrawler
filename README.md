The Web Crawler is a Python-based application designed to efficiently scrape and extract data from websites. Utilizing libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests, this tool navigates through web pages, collects specified information, and stores it in a structured format for further analysis or use.

#### Features:
- **Automated Data Extraction**: Scrapes data from multiple web pages with minimal manual intervention.
- **Customizable Filters**: Allows users to specify the type of data to be extracted, such as text, images, links, and more.
- **Efficient Parsing**: Uses BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML and XML documents, ensuring accurate and fast data retrieval.
- **Data Storage**: Saves extracted data in various formats like CSV, JSON, or directly into databases for easy access and analysis.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling to manage HTTP requests and parsing issues, ensuring the crawler runs smoothly.

#### How to Use:
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/utkarsh2302/webcrawler.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the Crawler**: Customize the target URLs and filters in the script, then execute `python webcrawler.py`

This project is ideal for those needing to gather large amounts of data from the web quickly and efficiently, such as for market research, academic research, or content aggregation.

#### Future Enhancements:
- **Multi-threading**: To increase the crawling speed by parallelizing the requests.
- **GUI Integration**: To provide a user-friendly interface for non-technical users.
- **Advanced Data Processing**: Incorporating machine learning to analyze and categorize the scraped data.
